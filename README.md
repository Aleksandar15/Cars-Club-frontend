# CARS CLUB

---

#### NOTE: I'm still working on this fullstack project - it's not yet finished & my main goal is to improve my TypeScript skills.

#### Plans & Features (in non-technical way):

- Login & Register sections.
- Section for cars info & specifications: Catalog.
- Section for posting cars for sales (allowed by all users): Marketplace.
- Posts will be connected to the OP user (original poster) & they can update or delete their post.
- Users not related to a particular post will be able to comment; they will be related to their own comment & be able to update and delete their own comment.

#### Technologies used:

###### Postgres DB, TypeScript, ReactJS with Redux Toolkit, NodeJS with ExpressJS

### Run my frontend project

- Clone this project.
- Navigate (`cd`) into your project directory.
- Run `npm install` in your command line.
- Run `npm run dev` in your command line.
- Visit http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
  - Vite version 4 has changed the PORT from 3000 to 5173.
- For the full functionality connect it with my <a href="https://github.com/Aleksandar15/Cars-Club-backend">backend</a> project.

#### How to's

- If you want to deploy this app on Netlify you should copy the code included in my <a href="https://github.com/Aleksandar15/Cars-Club-frontend/blob/main/netlify.toml">netlify.toml</a> file.

##### Sources

- For most of my SVG icons I've used a PNG version of icons8 and then converted that PNG into SVG using sites like https://www.pngtosvg.com.
