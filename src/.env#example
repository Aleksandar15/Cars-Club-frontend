Note that I don't need to use `dotenv` library because there's a Vite improvisation of it and to use it instead of the classical `REACT_APP_API_KEY` with `dotenv` where `REACT_APP_` is a _must_ prefix, in Vite I can simply use `VITE_REACT_` without any library:

`VITE_REACT_API_KEY = "123"`

`VITE_REACT_API_URL = "https://url`
